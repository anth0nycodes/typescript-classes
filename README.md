# TypeScript OOP Learning Guide

A comprehensive guide to learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, complete with detailed notes and hands-on exercises.

## 📚 What's Included

This repository contains everything you need to master TypeScript OOP concepts:

### Study Notes (7 Topics)

1. **Real-World Use Cases** - Understanding when and why to use classes
2. **Classes Basics** - Fundamentals, constructors, properties, and methods
3. **Access Modifiers & Encapsulation** - public, private, protected, readonly, and static
4. **Getters and Setters** - Property accessors, validation, and computed properties
5. **Inheritance** - Extending classes, method overriding, and the super keyword
6. **Abstract Classes** - Abstraction, abstract methods, and templates
7. **Interfaces & Polymorphism** - Contracts, multiple implementations, and polymorphism

### Exercises (6 Challenges)

Progressive exercises that build on each concept:

- Exercise 1: Basic Classes
- Exercise 2: Access Modifiers
- Exercise 3: Getters and Setters
- Exercise 4: Inheritance
- Exercise 5: Abstract Classes
- Exercise 6: Interfaces and Polymorphism

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v4 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd typescript-classes
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### For Learners

1. **Read the notes** in order (00-06):
   - Start with `00-real-world-use-cases.md`
   - Progress through each topic sequentially
   - Take your time to understand each concept

2. **Complete the exercises** from `exercises.md`:
   - Create separate `.ts` files for each exercise (e.g., `exercise1.ts`)
   - Complete one exercise at a time
   - Test your code by running: `npx ts-node exerciseX.ts`

3. **Practice and experiment**:
   - Modify the examples from the notes
   - Try creating your own classes
   - Combine concepts in creative ways

## 🛠️ Running Your TypeScript File

```bash
npm run dev
```
